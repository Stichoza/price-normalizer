### Statistics about odd prices
Psychological pricing or price ending or charm pricing is a marketing practice based on the theory that certain prices have a psychological impact. The retail prices are often expressed as "odd prices": a little less than a round number, e.g. $19.99 or £2.98. Consumers tend to perceive “odd prices” as being significantly lower than they actually are, tending to round to the next lowest monetary unit. Thus, prices such as $1.**99** is associated with spending $1 rather than $2. [Read more on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_pricing)
